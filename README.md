`/waze [indident]` -- incident can be 'police', 'crash', or 'hazard'
ex: `/waze police`

`/twaze` -- Hides blips and chat alerts from whatever users triggers the command by removing them from the list. (This is not permanent and must be done when the script is restarted or the user leaves and rejoins)
